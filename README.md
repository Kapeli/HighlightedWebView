HighlightedWebView
==================

WebView subclass that highlights all search results (like Safari), as well as highlight where the search results are in the scrollbar position (like Google Chrome).

Why use HighlightedWebView over other JavaScript alternatives (e.g. https://github.com/krawaller/prettySearch.js):
* It's Objective-C.
* It doesn't block the main thread.
